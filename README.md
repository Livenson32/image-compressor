# [img-compress](https://img-compress.pages.dev/) (live demo)

Img-compress is a fast, privacy-first image compressor that uses WebAssembly (wasm) to give near native compression speeds all in your browser. By using local client side processing, it bypasses traditional upload limits and data privacy concerns while giving you a highly customizable toolkit (img resizing, color reduction, lossless options, batch file renaming, etc).
